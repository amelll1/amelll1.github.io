	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hello my name is Mel Nezirovic! I'm a student studying IT at the University of Missouri. I'm still pretty new to the IT major. I'm not quite sure what I want to do within my major yet! This summer I plan to take time to work on discovering what I like as well as building my technical skills. 
		In my free time I like to do yoga and pilates. I also love the outdoors and start hiking when the weather gets nice enough. I'm really looking forward to going
		out to hike in the summertime. 
	</p>
