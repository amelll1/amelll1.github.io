	<h1>Hot Takes</h1>
	<p> Gumby's pizza is significantly better than Shakespeares. I just truly feel that Shakespeares is too greasy and overhyped.
		Gumby's is open much later, making it a perfect spot to stop after a night out, they also have all kinds of different kinds of pizza
		so I believe that sets them apart from their compeitor further!
		Dunkin Donuts is better than Starbucks. I believe that this is something people are afraid to admit and at one point I believed the opposite. 
		However, after getting the same drink at Starbucks multiple times and noticing that there was no consitency as far as taste, I changed my mind. 
		Also, Starbucks food is truly not that good and looks 3D printed. The Dunkin avocado toast along with a cold brew is superior!
		Fake tanning is better than a sun tan. As a fake tan enthusiast, I have tried both options and have come to the conclusion that fake tan 
		is the better option. Sure, it can feel nice to lie in the sun on a hot day, however it's truly not worth the skin damage. 
		I believe fake tan gets a bad reputation because it can lead to a streaky, uneven application. However, this can be resolved
		with the proper prepation as well as perfecting your technique. 
		Stanley water bottles are not worth the hype! I really feel strongly about this one, I vividly remember when they were on tiktok and almost everyone was buying one.
		After seeing the price tag, I do not think I can justify spending up to 50 dollars on a water bottle. They are also extremely inconvient given that they are huge and bulky,
		they cant fit into your backpack well and are just a bit awkward to carry.
